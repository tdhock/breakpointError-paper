	abstract = {{{\textless}p{\textgreater}Markov} chain Monte Carlo {(MCMC)} integration methods enable the fitting of models of virtually unlimited complexity, and as such have revolutionized the practice of Bayesian data analysis. However, comparison across models may not proceed in a completely analogous fashion, owing to violations of the conditions sufficient to ensure convergence of the Markov chain. In this paper we present a framework for Bayesian model choice, along with an {MCMC} algorithm that does not suffer from convergence difficulties. Our algorithm applies equally well to problems where only one model is contemplated but its proper size is not known at the outset, such as problems involving integer-valued parameters, multiple changepoints or finite mixture distributions. We illustrate our approach with two published examples.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Formal Bayesian model assessment is based on prior model probabilities {P(M=j)} and posterior model probabilities {P(M=jY)} after observing the data. An approach is outlined here that produces posterior model probabilities and hence Bayes factor estimates but not marginal likelihoods. It uses a Monte Carlo approximation based on independent {MCMC} sampling of two or more different models. While parallel sampling of the models is not necessary, such a form of sampling facilitates model averaging and assessing the impact of individual observations on the overall estimated Bayes factor. Three worked examples used before in model choice studies illustrate application of the method.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The estimates use pooled output for J models {(J{\textgreater}1)} whereby all models are updated at each iteration. Posterior probabilities are based on averages of continuous weights obtained for each model at each iteration, while samples of averaged parameters are obtained from iteration specific averages that are based on these weights. Parallel sampling of models assists in deriving posterior densities for parameter contrasts between models and in assessing hypotheses regarding model averaged parameters. Four worked examples illustrate application of the approach, two involving fixed effect regression, and two involving random effects.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{{\textless}p{\textgreater}Markov} chain Monte Carlo {(MCMC)} sampling strategies can be used to simulate hidden Markov model {(HMM)} parameters from their posterior distribution given observed data. Some {MCMC} methods used in practice (for computing likelihood, conditional probabilities of hidden states, and the most likely sequence of states) can be improved by incorporating established recursive algorithms. The most important of these is a set of forward-backward recursions calculating conditional distributions of the hidden states given observed data and model parameters. I show how to use the recursive algorithms in an {MCMC} context and demonstrate mathematical and empirical results showing a Gibbs sampler using the forward-backward recursions mixes more rapidly than another sampler often used for {HMMs.} I introduce an augmented variables technique for obtaining unique state labels in {HMMs} and finite mixture models. I show how recursive computing allows the statistically efficient use of {MCMC} output when estimating the hidden states. I directly calculate the posterior distribution of the hidden chain's state-space size by {MCMC,} circumventing asymptotic arguments underlying the Bayesian information criterion, which is shown to be inappropriate for a frequently analyzed dataset in the {HMM} literature. The use of log-likelihood for assessing {MCMC} convergence is illustrated, and posterior predictive checks are used to investigate application specific questions of model adequacy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

    abstract = {Gene dosage variations occur in many diseases. In cancer, deletions and copy number increases contribute to alterations in the expression of tumour-suppressor genes and oncogenes, respectively. Developmental abnormalities, such as Down, Prader Willi, Angelman and Cri du Chat syndromes, result from gain or loss of one copy of a chromosome or chromosomal region. Thus, detection and mapping of copy number abnormalities provide an approach for associating aberrations with disease phenotype and for localizing critical genes. Comparative genomic {hybridization3(CGH}) was developed for genome-wide analysis of {DNA} sequence copy number in a single experiment. In {CGH}, differentially labelled total genomic {DNA} from a 'test' and a 'reference' cell population are cohybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes, using blocking {DNA} to suppress signals from repetitive sequences. The resulting ratio of the fluorescence intensities at a location on the 'cytogenetic map', provided by the chromosomes, is approximately proportional to the ratio of the copy numbers of the corresponding {DNA} sequences in the test and reference genomes. {CGH} has been broadly applied to human and mouse malignancies. The use of metaphase chromosomes, however, limits detection of events involving small regions (of less than 20 Mb) of the genome, resolution of closely spaced aberrations and linking ratio changes to genomic/genetic markers. Therefore, more laborious locus-by-locus techniques have been required for higher resolution studies2, 3, 4, 5. Hybridization to an array of mapped sequences instead of metaphase chromosomes could overcome the limitations of conventional {CGH} (ref. 6) if adequate performance could be achieved. Copy number would be related to the test/reference fluorescence ratio on the array targets, and genomic resolution could be determined by the map distance between the targets, or by the length of the cloned {DNA} segments. We describe here our implementation of array {CGH}. We demonstrate its ability to measure copy number with high precision in the human genome, and to analyse clinical specimens by obtaining new information on chromosome 20 aberrations in breast cancer.},

    abstract = {This study describes a new tool for accurate and reliable high-throughput detection of copy number variation in the human genome. We have constructed a large-insert clone {DNA} microarray covering the entire human genome in tiling path resolution that we have used to identify copy number variation in human populations. Crucial to this study has been the development of a robust array platform and analytic process for the automated identification of copy number variants ({CNVs}). The array consists of 26,574 clones covering 93.7\% of euchromatic regions. Clones were selected primarily from the published "Golden Path," and mapping was confirmed by fingerprinting and {BAC}-end sequencing. Array performance was extensively tested by a series of validation assays. These included determining the hybridization characteristics of each individual clone on the array by chromosome-specific add-in experiments. Estimation of data reproducibility and false-positive/negative rates was carried out using self-self hybridizations, replicate experiments, and independent validations of {CNVs}. Based on these studies, we developed a variance-based automatic copy number detection analysis process ({CNVfinder}) and have demonstrated its robustness by comparison with the {SW}-{ARRAY} method. 10.1101/gr.5630906},

abstract ={Many biological pathways were first uncovered by
                  identifying mutants with visible phenotypes and by
                  scoring every sample in a screen via tedious and
                  subjective visual inspection. Now, automated image
                  analysis can effectively score many phenotypes. In
                  practical application, customizing an image-analysis
                  algorithm or finding a sufficient number of example
                  cells to train a machine learning algorithm can be
                  infeasible, particularly when positive control
                  samples are not available and the phenotype of
                  interest is rare. Here we present a supervised
                  machine learning approach that uses iterative
                  feedback to readily score multiple subtle and
                  complex morphological phenotypes in high-throughput,
                  image-based screens. First, automated cytological
                  profiling extracts hundreds of numerical descriptors
                  for every cell in every image. Next, the researcher
                  generates a rule (i.e., classifier) to recognize
                  cells with a phenotype of interest during a short,
                  interactive training session using iterative
                  feedback. Finally, all of the cells in the
                  experiment are automatically classified and each
                  sample is scored based on the presence of cells
                  displaying the phenotype. By using this approach, we
                  successfully scored images in RNA interference
                  screens in 2 organisms for the prevalence of 15
                  diverse cellular morphologies, some of which were
                  previously intractable.},

abstract ={Purpose For a comprehensive overview of the genetic alterations of neuroblastoma, their association and clinical significance, we conducted a whole-genome DNA copy number analysis.Patients and Methods A series of 493 neuroblastoma (NB) samples was investigated by array-based comparative genomic hybridization in two consecutive steps (224, then 269 patients).Results Genomic analysis identified several types of profiles. Tumors presenting exclusively whole-chromosome copy number variations were associated with excellent survival. No disease-related death was observed in this group. In contrast, tumors with any type of segmental chromosome alterations characterized patients with a high risk of relapse. Patients with both numerical and segmental abnormalities clearly shared the higher risk of relapse of segmental-only patients. In a multivariate analysis, taking into account the genomic profile, but also previously described individual genetic and clinical markers with prognostic significance, the presence of segmental alterations with (HR, 7.3; 95% CI, 3.7 to 14.5; P < .001) or without MYCN amplification (HR, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.4 to 8.4; P < .001) was the strongest predictor of relapse; the other significant variables were age older than 18 months (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.8; P = .004) and stage 4 (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.7; P = .005). Finally, within tumors showing segmental alterations, stage 4, age, MYCN amplification, 1p and 11q deletions, and 1q gain were independent predictors of decreased overall survival.Conclusion The analysis of the overall genomic pattern, which probably unravels particular genomic instability mechanisms rather than the analysis of individual markers, is essential to predict relapse in NB patients. It adds critical prognostic information to conventional markers and should be included in future treatment stratification.},

abstract ={Motivation: Microarray-based CGH (Comparative Genomic Hybridization), transcriptome arrays and other large-scale genomic technologies are now routinely used to generate a vast amount of genomic profiles. Exploratory analysis of this data is crucial in helping to understand the data and to help form biological hypotheses. This step requires visualization of the data in a meaningful way to visualize the results and to perform first level analyses.Results: We have developed a graphical user interface for visualization and first level analysis of molecular profiles. It is currently in use at the Institut Curie for cancer research projects involving CGH arrays, transcriptome arrays, SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) arrays, loss of heterozygosity results (LOH), and Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation arrays (ChIP chips). The interface offers the possibility of studying these different types of information in a consistent way. Several views are proposed, such as the classical CGH karyotype view or genome-wide multi-tumor comparison. Many functionalities for analyzing CGH data are provided by the interface, including looking for recurrent regions of alterations, confrontation to transcriptome data or clinical information, and clustering. Our tool consists of PHP scripts and of an applet written in Java. It can be run on public datasets at http://bioinfo.curie.fr/vampAvailability: The VAMP software (Visualization and Analysis of array-CGH,transcriptome and other Molecular Profiles) is available upon request. It can be tested on public datasets at http://bioinfo.curie.fr/vamp. The documentation is available at http://bioinfo.curie.fr/vamp/docContact:vamp@curie.fr},

abstract = {PurposeNeuroblastoma is characterized by two distinct
                  types of genetic profiles, consisting of either
                  numerical or segmental chromosome alterations. The
                  latter are associated with a higher risk of relapse,
                  even when occurring together with numerical
                  alterations. We explored the role of segmental
                  alterations in tumor progression and the possibility
                  of evolution from indolent to aggressive genomic
                  types.  Patients and MethodsArray-based comparative
                  genomic hybridization data of 394 neuroblastoma
                  samples were analyzed and linked to clinical data.
                  ResultsIntegration of ploidy and genomic data
                  indicated that pseudotriploid tumors with mixed
                  numerical and segmental profiles may be derived from
                  pseudotriploid tumors with numerical alterations
                  only. This was confirmed by the analysis of paired
                  samples, at diagnosis and at relapse, as in tumors
                  with a purely numerical profile at diagnosis
                  additional segmental alterations at relapse were
                  frequently observed. New segmental alterations at
                  relapse were also seen in patients with segmental
                  alterations at diagnosis. This was not linked to
                  secondary effects of cytotoxic treatments since it
                  occurred even in patients treated with surgery
                  alone. A higher number of chromosome breakpoints
                  were correlated with advanced age at diagnosis,
                  advanced stage of disease, with a higher risk of
                  relapse, and a poorer outcome.  ConclusionThese data
                  provide further evidence of the role of segmental
                  alterations, suggesting that tumor progression is
                  linked to the accumulation of segmental alterations
                  in neuroblastoma. This possibility of genomic
                  evolution should be taken into account in treatment
                  strategies of low- and intermediate-risk
                  neuroblastoma and should warrant biologic
                  reinvestigation at the time of relapse.  },

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Copy number variants (CNVs), including
                  deletions, amplifications, and other rearrangements,
                  are common in human and cancer genomes. Copy number
                  data from array comparative genome hybridization
                  (aCGH) and next-generation DNA sequencing is widely
                  used to measure copy number variants. Comparison of
                  copy number data from multiple individuals reveals
                  recurrent variants. Typically, the interior of a
                  recurrent CNV is examined for genes or other loci
                  associated with a phenotype. However, in some cases,
                  such as gene truncations and fusion genes, the
                  target of variant lies at the boundary of the
                  variant.RESULTS:We introduce Neighborhood Breakpoint
                  Conservation (NBC), an algorithm for identifying
                  rearrangement breakpoints that are highly conserved
                  at the same locus in multiple individuals. NBC
                  detects recurrent breakpoints at varying levels of
                  resolution, including breakpoints whose location is
                  exactly conserved and breakpoints whose location
                  varies within a gene. NBC also identifies pairs of
                  recurrent breakpoints such as those that result from
                  fusion genes. We apply NBC to aCGH data from 36
                  primary prostate tumors and identify 12 novel
                  rearrangements, one of which is the well-known
                  TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene. We also apply NBC to 227
                  glioblastoma tumors and predict 93 novel
                  rearrangements which we further classify as gene
                  truncations, germline structural variants, and
                  fusion genes. A number of these variants involve the
                  protein phosphatase PTPN12 suggesting that
                  deregulation of PTPN12, via a variety of
                  rearrangements, is common in
                  glioblastoma.CONCLUSIONS:We demonstrate that NBC is
                  useful for detection of recurrent breakpoints
                  resulting from copy number variants or other
                  structural variants, and in particular identifies
                  recurrent breakpoints that result in gene
                  truncations or fusion genes. Software is available
